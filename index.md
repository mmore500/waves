# Call for Participants

We are looking to recruit at least eight early-career participants (including undergraduate students) for a ten-week, funded, full-time, fully-remote software development workshop during the summer of 2021.

The goal of the workshop is four-fold:
1. to help participants advance their careers by skillbuilding through hands-on C++ and/or JavaScript software development in an academic setting,
2. to catalyze effective science communication and science pedagogy by helping participants develop the know-how to showcase their research through interactive web applications,
3. to jumpstart software development on web framework and core digital evolution tools in support of the next version of the Avida-ED scientific and educational software, and
4. to produce software that broadly enriches the digital evolution, scientific, education, and open-source communities.

This workshop is organized in conjunction with the [Avida-ED project](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/).
Avida-ED extends the full-fledged Avida software, originally developed for digital evolution research, as a freely-available, interactive web application.
This web application enables laboratory activities that teach evolution through experiments with self-replicating computer programs.
A curriculum of lesson plans and classroom materials, targeted to high school and university students, supports instructors.
Outreach and training puts these tools into hundreds of real-world classrooms.
From there, the team has used evidence-based methods to evaluate activities' effectiveness in terms of actualized learning outcomes.

Each WAVES workshop participant will collaborate with an assigned mentor on a software development project related to Avida-ED or the underlying scientific software tools that power it.
We will help participants choose projects based on their personal interests and background during the first week of the workshop.
We describe several possible project categories below.
Participants' projects will directly contribute open-source software to the foundation of future versions of Avida and Avida-ED.
To demonstrate their software, participants will build their own prototype scientific web application/mini research project or contribute to an existing web application/research project.
As a culmination of their workshop experience and an exercise in professional communication, participants will publish a blog post describing how their software works and how to use it.
Check out last year's project write-ups [here](http://mmore500.com/waves/blog.html)!

During the workshop, participants will also engage in a weekly software discussion group and a weekly group check-in meeting.

## Logistics

The virtual workshop will take place between **June 14, 2021** and **August 20, 2021**.
If these dates don't work for you, we may be able to shift this schedule by a week or two for individual participants.
Let us know in your application and we will do our best to accommodate you.
Participants will be expected to commit to full-time (approximately 40 hours/week) engagement with the workshop.
To accommodate multiple U.S. time zones, all group meetings will be held over videoconference sometime between noon and 5pm EST (GMT-4).
A **$6,000** stipend will be disbursed to participants in five bi-weekly installments of $1,200.

All U.S. citizens/permanent residents are eligible to apply, as are international students already enrolled at Michigan State University.
The workshop will be aimed at upper-level undergraduates in computer science, but graduate students or other early-career computer scientists are also welcome to apply.
Past workshop participants are welcome to apply, as well.

We are seeking participants with prior practical experience in computer science: writing and running software of some sort.

## Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Pervasive systemic inequities exist within our society with respect to systematic marginalization and exploitation of certain groups, including with respect to race, sex, sexuality, socioeconomic status, disability, age, and religion. These inequities harm both members of underrepresented groups and the vibrancy of our professional communities and our wider society. We hold our own professional communities (academia, computer science, evolutionary biology) accountable for our role perpetuating this injustice, and we must continue to work to address it. Advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion is critical to advancing our professions and strengthening our society.

We aim to fulfill our duties as workshop organizers in a manner cognizant of the continuing history of pervasive systemic inequity. We commit to acting, to the extent possible, to allay these inequities within our workshop and support our community in grappling with them. We also commit to actions that contribute to dismantling systematic inequality.

Among other actions, we will
* Refer to workshop members using appropriate pronouns, names or nicknames, and pronunciations.
* Review workshop applications holistically.
   * Valuing experiences like mentorship, service, and commitment to your community with the same respect as experiences such as research, coursework, and project completion.
   * Understanding that not all applicants have been exposed to the same opportunities and evaluating applicants’ experiences in context.
* Ensuring that our Call for Participants is distributed so that it reaches members of underrepresented groups and providing special encouragement for them to apply.
* Recruiting workshop members that share our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
* Committing to flexibility, recognizing that workshop members’ time, schedule, and capacity may change throughout the workshop and working to accommodate our members’ needs professionally and personally.
* Recognizing diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness as a critical element of professional development and organizing workshop enrichment to address it.
* Quantitatively assessing inclusivity in terms of our workshop application pool, our workshop facilitators, and our workshop participants.
* Assessing equity and inclusion via surveys administered to workshop members.
Designing the format of workshop meetings and social events to promote equitable participation.
